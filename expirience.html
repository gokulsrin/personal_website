            <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
            Assistant at the Cavanagh-Tse joint lab investigating the nature of consciousness through visual stimulus. 
            <p></p>
            Thus far, I have been tasked with the coding of, and implementation of pupilatory interpolation algorithms in MATLAB and Python. More generally, I have worked in Python and MATLAB to code help code Psychophysics experiments and EEG/MRI data analysis algorithms. By viewing the results of these experiments, we can better understand the nature and location of consciousness in the brain.
            <h3>Tools Utilized:</h3>
            PsychoPy, Python, Numpy, Matlab, Microsoft Excel

            <h3>Bioinformatics and Clinical Health Intern</h3>
            Working under the guidance of Dr. Eden and Dr. Nelson, as well as the OHSU Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, I leveraged FHIR tools to populate MammoScreen (a breast cancer screening tool) with critical patient data.
            <p></p>
            Over a period of 10 weeks, I had the privilege of taking a project feature from conception to completion. Using my knowledge of data structures, and general familiarity with JavaScript, I was able to create an information retrieval and storage tool, allowing MammoScreen to pull and push relevant patient data. Specifically, I was able to use SMART on FHIR, a tool created by the Boston Children's Hospital, to interact with a Cerner EHR platform.
            <h3>Tools Utilized:</h3>
            SMART on FHIR, FHIR v4.0.1, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Git, Github

            <h3>FEMA Region 10 Youth Representative</h3>
            As a council member on the FEMA Region 10 Youth Preparedness Council, I worked to create innovative solutions to preparedness issues: connecting the old to the young, the state to the local, and private industries to public services. 
            <p></p>
            During my tenure, I was granted the privilege of speaking on Oregon Public Broadcasting about disaster preparedness and creating a culture of preparedness. I was able to work with the Red Cross, Meals on Wheels, and FEMA Region 10 to create a way to distribute preparedness products to senior citizens.
            <h3>Tools Utilized:</h3>
            Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Google Documents
